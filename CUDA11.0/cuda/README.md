# A Directory for CUDA 9 Runfile

Let's say you want to use CUDA version 11.1.0_455, put the file "cuda_11.0.3_450.51.06_linux.run" in this directory.
```
wget https://developer.download.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/11.0.3/local_installers/cuda_11.0.3_450.51.06_linux.run
```
Note: you might need to revise the Dockerfile for the filename changes.
