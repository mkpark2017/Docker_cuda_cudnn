# A Directory for CUDA 9 Runfile

Let's say you want to use CUDA version 10.1.105, put the file "cuda_10.1.105_418.39_linux.run" in this directory. wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/10.1/Prod/local_installers/cuda_10.1.105_418.39_linux.run

Note: you might need to revise the Dockerfile for the filename changes.
