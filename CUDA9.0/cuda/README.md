# A Directory for CUDA 9 Runfile

Let's say you want to use CUDA version 9.0.176, put the file "cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run" in this directory.
wget https://developer.nvidia.com/compute/cuda/9.0/Prod/local_installers/cuda_9.0.176_384.81_linux-run

Note: you might need to revise the Dockerfile for the filename changes.
