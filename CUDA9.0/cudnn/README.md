# A Directory for CUDNN 7

Let's say you want to use CUDNN version 7.1 for CUDA 9.0, put the file "cudnn-9.0-linux-x64-v7.1.tgz" in this directory. 

You have to download above file from "https://developer.nvidia.com/rdp/cudnn-archive"

Let's say download Download cuDNN v7.1.4 (May 16, 2018), for CUDA 9.0 / cuDNN v7.1.4 Library for Linux

Note: you might need to revise the Dockerfile for the filename changes.
